Zen5 Gentoo AI Installation
A streamlined Gentoo Linux installation system for AMD Zen 5 processors with NVIDIA GPUs, optimized for AI/ML workloads.
Overview
This project provides scripts to automate the installation of Gentoo Linux following the official Gentoo Handbook and Full Disk Encryption Guide.
Features

Full disk encryption with LUKS2
LVM for flexible storage management
Btrfs filesystem with subvolumes for snapshots
Mirrored storage for AI datasets and models
Optimized for AMD Zen 5 processors
NVIDIA GPU acceleration with CUDA
Python environment for AI/ML development

Prerequisites

Gentoo Linux live USB
Internet connection
AMD Zen 5 processor
NVIDIA GPU (RTX 5000 series or similar)
Two NVMe drives (recommended 2TB each)

Quick Start

Boot from Gentoo Linux live USB
Download and extract this repository:

bashwget https://github.com/yourusername/zen5-gentoo-ai/archive/main.tar.gz
tar xzf main.tar.gz
cd zen5-gentoo-ai-main

Run the installation script:

bashbash install.sh

Detailed Installation Steps
The installation process is divided into these main phases:

Preparation: Partition disks, setup encryption, configure LVM
Base System: Create filesystems, extract stage3, configure base system
System Configuration: Install kernel, bootloader, networking
AI Environment: Setup NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, Python, and ML libraries

Customization
You can customize the installation by editing the configuration files in the config/ directory:

make.conf: Compiler options and USE flags
kernel.config: Kernel configuration
system.conf: General system settings

Post-Installation
After installation, you'll have a complete Gentoo system with:

Full disk encryption
AI/ML development environment at /tensor_lab
Python virtual environment with PyTorch, CUDA support
Optimized kernel for AMD Zen 5 processors
